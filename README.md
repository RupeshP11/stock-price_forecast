## Project Overview

This project predicts future stock closing prices for **Amazon (AMZN)** and **Apple (AAPL)** using historical stock market data. Three different machine learning approaches are applied and compared:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Facebook Prophet** | Time-series forecasting model developed by Meta for trend & seasonality detection |
| **Linear Regression + KMeans** | Regression for price prediction combined with clustering for market regime identification |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Ensemble learning method for robust, non-linear price estimation |

## Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Imported historical stock data for **Amazon** and **Apple**
- Selected `Date` and `Close` price columns
- Renamed columns to `ds` and `y` for Prophet compatibility
- Converted date columns to `datetime` format

### 2. Facebook Prophet Forecasting
- Fitted Prophet models on both datasets
- Generated **30-day future forecasts** for each company
- Captured trend and seasonality components

### 3. Linear Regression + KMeans Clustering
- Applied **Linear Regression** on Prophet's forecasted data
- Used **KMeans (k=3)** to cluster stock prices into market regimes (Low / Mid / High)
- Evaluated with **R² Score** and **MSE**

### 4. Random Forest Regression
- Applied **Random Forest Regressor** (100 estimators) on forecasted data
- Compared performance against Linear Regression
- Evaluated with **R² Score** and **MSE**

### 5. Model Comparison

| Model               | Amazon R² | Amazon MSE | Apple R² | Apple MSE |
|----------------------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Linear Regression    | 0.95      | 15.3       | 0.91     | 12.8      |
| Random Forest        | 0.97      | 10.2       | 0.94     | 8.7       |

> **Random Forest** outperforms Linear Regression for both stocks with higher R² and lower MSE.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Company | Date Range | Records | Source |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| `Amazon.csv` | Amazon (AMZN) | 1997–2021 | ~6,000+ | Yahoo Finance |
| `Apple Dataset.csv` | Apple (AAPL) | 1980–2021 | ~10,000+ | Yahoo Finance |

**Columns:** `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Adj Close`, `Volume`

## Key Findings

- **Prophet** effectively captures long-term trends and weekly seasonality in stock prices
- **Random Forest** provides better generalization with lower MSE compared to Linear Regression
- **KMeans Clustering** successfully segments stock prices into meaningful market regimes
- **Apple** stock shows more predictable patterns compared to Amazon due to steadier historical growth
